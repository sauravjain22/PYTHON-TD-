# Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 


# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
# 2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
# 3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.



def factorial(number):
    if number == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        fact = number * factorial(number - 1)
        return fact
    
n = int(input("Enter number: "))
print(factorial(n))



# Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
 
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
# 2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
# o   Square root of the number
# o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
# o   Sine of the number (in radians)
# 3.   Displays the calculated results.


import math
number  = float(input("Enter number: "))
square_root = math.sqrt(number)
logarithm = math.log(number)
sine = math.sin(number)

print("square root",square_root)
print("logarithm",logarithm)
print("sine",sine)
